     * Get events on a resource

     * GET /events
     *
     * Returns the set of events that have occurred since the last sync token was generated.
     * The Events API uses a sync token-based mechanism to provide incremental updates.
     *
     * On the first call, provide only the resource GID; the response will include a sync token
     * but no events. Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
     * immediately preceding call to receive events that occurred since that token was generated.
     *
     * A new sync token will always be included in every response. If the sync token is too old
     * (expired), the API will return an error (412 Precondition Failed) but will still include
     * a new sync token to use for future requests.
     *
     * API Documentation: https://developers.asana.com/reference/getevents

     *                            This can be a task, project, or other Asana resource.
     *                            Example: "12345"
     * @param string|null $syncToken A sync token received from a previous getEvents call.
     *                               Pass null on the first call to establish the initial
     *                               sync position. The API will return a new sync token
     *                               with each response.
     *                               Example: "de4774f6915eae04714ca93bb2f5ee81"

     *                      - opt_pretty (bool): Returns formatted JSON if true
     * @param int $responseType The type of response to return:
     *                              - AsanaApiClient::RESPONSE_FULL (1): Full response with status, headers, etc.
     *                              - AsanaApiClient::RESPONSE_NORMAL (2): Complete decoded JSON body (default)
     *                              - AsanaApiClient::RESPONSE_DATA (3): Only the data subset
     *                              Note: The default response type is RESPONSE_NORMAL (not RESPONSE_DATA) to ensure
     *                              the sync token is included in the response for subsequent requests.
     *
     * @return array The response data based on the specified response type:

     *                 - resource: The resource that was affected

     *                 - action: The action that occurred (e.g., "changed", "added", "removed")
     *                 - parent: The parent resource if applicable
